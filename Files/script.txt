Create a website using React and Redux (Frontend)to simulate the basic functionality of a web shop. The following
sections should be implemented:

Catalog: A web page where a list of products is displayed showing basic information of
each one and enabling the user to add a defined quantity of the product to a shopping
cart. The following operations should be supported:
• Listing of products: Displaying title, Product Code, small description, price, and
available stock.
• Shopping Cart: The user should be able to add a specific quantity of the product
(determined by the user through a numeric text box) to a virtual Shopping Cart.
• Paging: A maximum of 10 products per page.
• Shopping Cart storage: You should store the products added by the user, however
you should use a different type of storage than Database, like session, memory, etc.
• Stock Validation: Before adding the defined quantity to the shopping cart, you
should validate if there is stock available.
